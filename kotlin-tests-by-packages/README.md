# Kotlin Tests By Packages
This project shows you how to separate tests using packages with Gradle.

- To execute all tests you run `./gradlew clean check`
- To execute all unit tests you run `./gradle clean test`
- To execute all integration tests you run `./gradle clean integrationTest`

## Unit testing options
- All unit tests live under the application `src/test` directory

## Integration testing
- All integration tests live under the `src/integrationTest` directory
